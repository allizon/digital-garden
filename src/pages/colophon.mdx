# Colophon

## Technologies

**Gatsby (and consequently React).** I first tried making a Gatsby site in 2020, and it didn't really quite stick at the time. I think looking back that it was because my React skills were not as strong then as they are now -- bits of React-ness that were really confusing to 2020-Me make much, much more sense to 2022-Me.

**Tailwind CSS.**

**MDX.** This very page is written using MDX!

**Gatsby Cloud via Github**. I just push to Github and presto! New site build a couple of minutes later!

## Fonts

Currently it's just Roboto with Roboto Slab for titles.

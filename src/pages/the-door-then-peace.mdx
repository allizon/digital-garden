### How the ending of _The Good Place_ helped me deal with the loss of my father.

My father passed away two months ago. His death was neither sudden nor tragic - he'd been sick for some time, in and out of the hospital for the last couple of years. At the end, he'd been in for a month and spent his last week or so in a nautical-themed hospice suite, though I doubt he even noticed.

When his time to go arrived, he went peacefully; on his final morning, he just slid away in his sleep, surrounded by the quiet conversation of his wife of almost thirty years, his best friend of more than forty, and his beloved nephew he became quite close to late in life. All of a sudden, without any fuss or fanfare, my father simply…wasn't.

I had thought I had finished with all of the crying I was going to do over my dad's passing. I knew I wasn't done mourning, that comes and goes for some time in smaller and smaller waves, but I'm not usually much of a crier, and I assumed I was done with that part.

But then I watched the series finale of _The Good Place_.

All stories end. _The Good Place_ knows that - this is a show, after all, that chose its own time to gracefully bow out - and it wants us to understand that it's okay that they end, even when we don't want them to. Perhaps especially then.

An old adage says that every story ends in tragedy if you follow it long enough - if a story has a happy ending, then it's not truly the ending yet. _TGP_ illustrates that beautifully; at the end of the penultimate episode, all of our characters receive their much-deserved happy endings, paired off like in any good comedy. Yet their stories aren't complete, of course. We haven't followed them all the way through.

First Jason, then my beloved Chidi, and finally Eleanor allow themselves simply no longer to be, to wrap up the thousands upon thousands of lifetimes they've lived in the afterlife and, at last, let go. Tahani and Michael both have chapters left to write in their books, yet someday, their stories must also come to a close. Janet's story will surely go on the longest, but eventually even she (and Maximum Derek, of course) will succumb to the heat death of the universe. (Presumably.)

None of it is tragic. All of it is beautiful.

Letting go is one of the very most fundamentally human experiences we can endure; it's literally one of the only experiences every single one of us is guaranteed. We can fight it, we can deny it, we can live our lives wrapped in safety bubbles to put it off as long as we can - but all of us will face it eventually, and all of us have no choice but to give in.

But, as _TGP_ argues, it's that very ending, that final letting-go, that gives our stories meaning. A vacation isn't a vacation if it never ends. It's the knowing that our time is limited to that creates and informs our priorities, our goals, the ways in which we spend our time and whom to spend it with. The older we get, the more that the time behind us outgrows the time left in front of us, the more clarity and focus we gain.

I see my father wandering into a clearing in an ancient redwood forest. In this vision, I see him not as the frail man he was at the end of his life, but as he was when he was about the age I am now - no longer young, but still healthy before old age weakened him. He takes a seat on the natural wooden bench nearby; a calm, pleasant voice in his ear tells him to stay as long as he'd like, and whenever he's ready, he can walk through the tangle of branches shaped vaguely like a doorframe at the edge of the clearing, and that will be that.

I like to think he thinks fondly of me as he sits on that bench, looking up at the treetops stretching into the sky, that he's proud of me; I'd imagine he spends a some thinking of my sister, and of his daughter-in-law and his three amazing grandchildren. I'm sure he remembers the adventures and laughter and love with the wife he adored. He can hear her voice - hers wasn't that voice in his ear from earlier, but he hears her and her laughter, and he hears the other voices surrounding him, and he is at peace.

He stands up, and with one final deep breath, he walks through the gnarled suggestion of a door frame, and then he…isn't.

My own story is far nearer to its ending than its beginning. I know that. My time walking through that quiet forest door will be upon me sooner than I'd like. I'm certainly well past my halfway point. I'm almost fifty years old, and barring some unforeseen accident or illness, I suspect I have between twenty-five and thirty more years here, give or take a few. Three decades seems like plenty of time until I realize that thirty years ago was 1990, which feels almost like yesterday.

I don't feel afraid of my end itself - I've never thought there was anything to fear about death, and it's not as if there's anything I can do to prevent its arrival or my departure. What I do fear, though, is regret. I'm afraid of wasting the time that's given to me, of not doing enough, of not being enough for my family, my friends, my community, my world. I think I'm doing okay on this front for now - overall, I'm pretty sure my points are in the net positive - but still I strive to do more, to do better.

For a while, I was concerned about legacy, about how I'm going to be remembered after I'm gone, but I've come to realize that's not something I have even the least bit of control over, so I'd rather just concentrate on what I do while I'm here. I want to Do Some Good, whatever that ultimately means.

I have time, I hope, but unlike my friends from _The Good Place_, I just have the one lifetime, and I have to get to work.

I feel my father's passing, two-thousand miles away. It's noon on a chilly December Monday, and I stand up from my desk to make myself some toast, asking my wife if she'd like some, too. I walk into the kitchen, drop four slices of wheat bread in the toaster, and then suddenly, my skin vibrates, my vision goes a little fuzzy, and I'm sure of it: he's gone.

There's no way I can possibly know that, of course. I tell myself that my brain's just doing that thing it does where it plays tricks on me, throwing up curve balls to see if I'll swing at them. I need to be rational here; sure, he's in hospice and could go any time, but that's not something I can know. All I can do is wait for the phone call.

(I've been waiting for the phone call for weeks, months, years.)

But then - not even two minutes later, my rational brain still insisting to myself I'm being silly - my phone rings, and I see my stepmother's name and number, and I know I'm right.

I didn't understand it then, but I know what happened now. My father passed under those branches and his essence returned to the universe, his water to the ocean, and he became tiny iridescent golden sparks of pure good. One of those sparks fell down on me as I stood in my kitchen staring at my toaster - I felt the lightest touch on the back of my neck and my skin tingled and my vision blurred and my father said goodbye to me from two-thousand miles and another plane of existence away.

# Hi there, I'm Allison.
I'm just getting this page set up so...patience, okay? Consider the work I'm doing on the site to be "showing my work" &mdash; I'm letting it be live during development, and the [source code is up on Github](https://github.com/allizon/digital-garden).

## Who I Am
I've been a professional web developer for more than two decades, hard that is to believe. (Well, I don't know how hard it is for _you_ to believe, but it's really disconcerting for _me_.) I originally started working on the website for the magazine I worked for way back in 1998, fell in love with the whole website-building business and never looked back. That means I'm technically in my fourth different decade of doing this for a living!

## What I've Done
I've worked for several video game companies and even won a [Webby award in 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Webby_Awards) for [the work I did](https://web.archive.org/web/20100612045817/http://www.thebeatlesrockband.com/) at one of them. I've worked as a defense contractor -- if I'm being honest, working at game companies was more fun, but working for big software companies was way more stable and secure.

I've been at this a long time...there were no build tools for _anything_, these were just websites! Just painstakingly hand-crafted text files! You whippersnappers, what with your frameworks and build systems and tooling and whatnot -- y'all don't know the pain of building all of your HTML and Javascript by hand! You don't know what it's like to have to slice your images into highly-optimized pieces so you can whittle the file size down so your whole page is under a 100kb and  won't take forever to load on dial-up connections! And what's this new-fangled "CSS" thing?

I'm kidding, kinda -- I started there, but for the last few years I've been working primarily in Javascript (mainly React) and Ruby on Rails.

## What I Want To Do
I want to teach people how to be better developers, to help people, maybe even entertain them while doing so.
